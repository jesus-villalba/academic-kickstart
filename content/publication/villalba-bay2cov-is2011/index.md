abstract = "We propose a variational Bayes solution to integrate out the model parameters in a generative i-vector speaker recognizer. The existing state-of-the-art in g$backslash$ enerative i-vector modelling plugs in fixed maximum-likelihood point-estimates of model parameters. This recipe may suffer from over-fitting of especially th$backslash$ e between-speaker covariance. We show how to integrate out the between-speaker covariance and demonstrate dramatic improvements on NIST SRE 2010."
