abstract = "In adverse acoustic conditions, speaker verification and identification system rates degrade very significatively. In order to compensate this effect, several techniques can be applied. In this paper Phoneme Dependent Multi-Environment Models based LInear Normalization, PD-MEMLIN, is presented as a solution in order to clean signal in a early processing step. In this algorithm, clean and noisy spaces are modelled by mixtures of gaussians for each phoneme, and a linear transformation is learnt with stereo data for each phoneme pair of gaussians: one for the clean space and the other one for the noisy space. Some experiments with Spanish SpeechDat Car database were carried out in order to study the behavior of the proposed technique in verification and identification tasks. With an UBM-GMM verification system, important average improvement in Equal- Error Rate (EER) is obtained (70.20%). The improvement in identification task with aGMMsystem is 48.69%."
