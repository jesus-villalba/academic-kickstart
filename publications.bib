abstract = {We describe in this paper the experiences of the Johns Hop-kins University team during the inaugural DIHARD diarization evaluation. This new task provided microphone recordings in a variety of difficult conditions and challenged researchers to fully consider all speaker activity, without the currently typi-cal practices of unscored collars or ignored overlapping speaker segments. This paper includes details about research decisions made in the process of the evaluation, including explorations of training data, feature bandwidth, speech activity detection, and i-vector versus x-vector representations. The utility of sys-tem fusions and domain-specific processing are also considered. In all cases, deeper analyses are presented using the develop-ment data, for which truth labels were given during the evalu-ation, while evaluation scores are only presented for a subset of the systems. Finally, we discuss lessons learned and remain-ing challenges left for future work within the lens of this new approach to diarization performance measurement.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2016. The goal of this paper is to study the inclusion of deep learning into the diarization task. We propose some novel approaches at the feature extraction stage, substituting the classical usage of short-term features, such as MFCCs and PLPs, by Deep Learning based ones. These new features come from the hidden states at bottleneck layers in neural networks. Trained for ASR tasks. These new features will be included in the University of Zaragoza ViVoLAB speaker diarization system, designed for the Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB) challenge of the 2015 ASRU Workshop. This system, designed following the i-vector paradigm, uses the input features to segment the input audio and construct one i-vector per segment. These i-vectors will be clustered into speakers according to generative PLDA models. The evaluation for our new approach will be carried out with broadcast audio from the 2015 MGB Challenge.},

@inproceedings{miguel-is14,
abstract = {Factor analysis is a method for embedding high dimensional data into a lower dimensional factor space. When data are multimodal we use mixtures of factor analyzers (MFA), which assume statistically independent samples. In speaker recogni- tion, samples are not independent because they depend on the speaker in the utterance. In joint factor analysis and i-vectors, theMFA latent factors are tied at different levels. For example, they can be tied for a segment to extract utterance level informa- tion. Tied MFA approaches usually present the drawback that computing the exact posterior of the hidden variables (compo- nent responsibilities and latent factors) is unfeasible. For JFA, the preferred approximation consists in computing the respon- sibilities given a speaker independent GMM and they are fixed during the rest of the process. That implies that the estimated responsibilities for a given sample are independent of the rest of the samples of the utterance not taking into account the shared speaker and channel. We present a novel approximation to jointly estimate responsibilities and latent factors based on sam- pling the latent factor space. This model differs from previous ones in the hidden variables and parameter estimation; and like- lihood evaluation. This approach was tested on the RSR2015 database for text-dependent speaker recognition Index},

Traditionally, this problem has been handled training the LDA covariance matrices pooling the data of all the conditions or averaging the covariance matrices of each condition in different ways. We present a PLDA variant that we call, multichannel SPLDA, where the speaker space distribution is common to all i-vectors and the channel space distribution depends on the type of channel where the segment has been recorded. We test our approach on the telephone part of the NIST SRE10 extended condition where we have added some additive noises to the test segments. We compare results of a SPLDA model trained only with clean data, SPLDA trained with pooled noisy and clean data and our MCSPLDA model.},

The collaboration focused on collecting and sharing training data for those target languages for which few development data were provided by NIST, and on defining a common development dataset to train backend and fusion parameters and select the best fusions. Official and post-key results are presented and compared, revealing that the greedy approach applied to select the best fusions provided suboptimal but very competitive performance. Several factors contributed to the high performance attained by BLZ systems, including the availability of training data for low resource target languages, the reliability of the development dataset (consisting only of data audited by NIST), the diversity of modeling approaches, features and datasets in the systems considered for fusion, and the effectiveness of the search for optimal fusions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a system for detecting spoofing attacks on speaker verification systems. We understand as spoofing the fact of impersonating a legitimate user. We focus on detecting two types of low technology spoofs. On the one side, we try to expose if the test segment is a far-field microphone recording of the victim that has been replayed on a telephone handset using a loudspeaker. On the other side, we want to determine if the recording has been created by cutting and pasting short recordings to forge the sentence requested by a text dependent system. This kind of attacks is of critical importance for security applications like access to bank accounts. To detect the first type of spoof we extract several acoustic features from the speech signal. Spoofs and non-spoof segments are classified using a support vector machine (SVM). The cut and paste is detected comparing the pitch and MFCC contours of the enrollment and test segments using dynamic time warping (DTW). We performed experiments using two databases created for this purpose. They include signals from land line and GSM telephone channels of 20 different speakers. We present results of the performance separately for each spoofing detection system and the fusion of both. We have achieved error rates under 10$\backslash${\%} for all the conditions evaluated. We show the degradation on the speaker verification performance in the presence of this kind of attack and how to use the spoofing detection to mitigate that degradation.},

abstract = {Best language recognition performance is commonly obtained by fusing the scores of several heterogeneous systems. Regardless the fusion approach, it is assumed that different systems may contribute complementary information, either because they are developed on different datasets, or because they use different features or different modeling approaches. Most authors apply fusion as a final resource for improving performance based on an existing set of systems. Though relative performance gains decrease as larger sets of systems are considered, best performance is usually attained by fusing all the available systems, which may lead to high computational costs. In this paper, we aim to discover which technologies combine the best through fusion and to analyse the factors (data, features, modeling methodologies, etc.) that may explain such a good performance. Results are presented and discussed for a number of systems provided by the participating sites and the organizing team of the Albayzin 2010 Language Recognition Evaluation. We hope the conclusions of this work help research groups make better decisions in developing language recognition technology.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of a Factor Analysis stage in audio segmentation systems. The system described here is designed to segment and classify the audio files coming from broadcast programs into five different classes: speech, speech with noise, speech with music, music or others. This task was recently proposed as a competitive evaluation organized by the Spanish Network on Speech Technologies as part of the conference FALA 2010. The system proposed here makes use of a hierarchical structure in two steps with two different acoustic features. First, the system decides among music, speech with music or the rest of the classes by using HMM/GMM and a smoothed combination of MFCC and Chroma as feature vectors. Next, the system classifies speech and speech with noise by using FA and MFCC as acoustic features. The results shows that, with this configuration, the error rate achieved is lower than the one obtained by the best system presented in the FALA 2010 evaluation.},

In this paper Phoneme Dependent Multi-Environment Models based LInear Normalization, PD-MEMLIN, is presented as a solution in order to clean signal in a early processing step. In this algorithm, clean and noisy spaces are modelled by mixtures of gaussians for each phoneme, and a linear transformation is learnt with stereo data for each phoneme pair of gaussians: one for the clean space and the other one for the noisy space. Some experiments with Spanish SpeechDat Car database were carried out in order to study the behavior of the proposed technique in verification and identification tasks. With an UBM-GMM verification system, important average improvement in Equal- Error Rate (EER) is obtained (70.20{\%}). The improvement in identification task with aGMMsystem is 48.69{\%}.},
